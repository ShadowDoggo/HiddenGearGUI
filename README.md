### WARNING: Backup your save before using this. Using hidden gear online will get you banned. I am not responsible for any bans caused by this tool.

## How to use:

You'll need a homebrewed Wii U with [Mocha CFW](https://github.com/dimok789/mocha) and [TCPGecko](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko) running. The UI is pretty self-explanatory. Enter your console's IP and unlock the gear you want.

Download the latest version of the tool from releases, extract it somewhere, and run the HiddenGearGui.pyw file.

If you don't have Python installed, get the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org).

## Troubleshooting errors:

### Could not connect:

Make sure that your Wii U and computer are on the same network, nothing else is connected to TCPGecko, and that you entered the right IP address.
If you still can't connect, check your firewall settings.

### Could not get diff:

You're probably using an outdated version of TCPGecko. Get the latest version.

### Could not unlock:

Same as "Could not get diff". Make sure you have the latest TCPGecko.
