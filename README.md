### WARNING: Using hidden gear online will get you banned. Use this at your own risk and backup your save before unlocking anything. I'm not responsible for any bans.

## How to use:

You'll need a homebrewed Wii U with [Mocha CFW](https://github.com/dimok789/mocha) and [TCPGecko](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko) running. The UI is pretty self-explanatory. Enter your console's IP and unlock the gear you want.

Download the latest version from releases and run the HiddenGearGui.exe file.
