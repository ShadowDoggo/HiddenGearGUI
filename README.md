### WARNING: Backup your save before using this. Using hidden gear online will get you banned. I am not responsible for any bans caused by this tool.

## How to use:

You'll need a homebrewed Wii U with [Mocha CFW](https://github.com/dimok789/mocha) and [TCPGecko](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko) running. The UI is pretty self-explanatory. Enter your console's IP and unlock the gear you want.

Download the latest version of the tool from releases, extract it somewhere, and run the HiddenGearGui.pyw file.

If you don't have Python installed, get the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org).
